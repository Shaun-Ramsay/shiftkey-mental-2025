It's understandable to feel anxious about a work meeting.  Many people experience this.  Deep breathing exercises can help calm your heart rate before the meeting.  Try practicing what you want to say beforehand.  Remember everyone makes mistakes; it's okay if you stumble.  Focus on your key points and don't worry about perfection.  Your colleagues likely want you to succeed.  If you need more help, consider reaching out to a mental health professional.
