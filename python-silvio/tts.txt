I understand. Calculus, especially derivatives, can be tough.  It's frustrating when you feel your professor isn't providing enough support.  There are lots of online resources that explain derivatives in different ways.  Khan Academy and YouTube have excellent tutorials.  Would you like me to help you find some?  Maybe we can work through some practice problems together.  Remember, it takes time and practice to master calculus. Don't give up!
